        <h3>HTML5 & CSS</h3>
        <p>Although I have much to learn, I am well acquainted with HTML5 & CSS. I began learning HTML5 & CSS in July 2022 as a summer hobby and was quickly intrigued with the intricacies of web development. I am currently working on improving my knowledge of JavaScript with hopes of becoming a Full Stack Developer soon.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>I also consider myself a pro-homecook. I began cooking in college, as it was a much more budget-friendly option for a broke college kid than eating out for every meal. When the 2020 COVID Pandemic hit and I was forced to stay home, I had a plethora of free time to hone my amateur culinary skills. Since then, my love for cooking has only grown.</p>
